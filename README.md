# Gpt-Bot
Information about the Project:
- Chat GPT Bot is an assistant application with a visual user interface developed using Tkinter in Python language.
- Chat GPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI. This model provides an ideal foundation for natural language processing and dialogue systems due to its extensive language knowledge and understanding capabilities.
- The application allows users to interact with Chat GPT directly by entering text. Chat GPT understands user questions and generates responses.
- There is a section for storing the API key. This allows users to save their own API keys and use them when needed.

Key Points:
1. User Interface: The visual user interface developed using Tkinter provides a user-friendly experience. It includes an input field for entering text and an output area for displaying Chat GPT's responses.
2. API Integration: Storing and using the OpenAI API key enables Chat GPT to generate real-time responses. API integration allows Chat GPT to access up-to-date information and provide accurate answers.
3. Text Clearing: The clear button for question input and response area allows users to easily clear their previous text. This feature ensures a cleaner and more organized user interface.
